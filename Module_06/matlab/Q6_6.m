%% EXERCISE 6.8
% The torque M acting on the gimbal of the gyroscopic turn indicator is
% exerted by a torsional spring, so M = âˆ’kÎ². The precession rate 2 is a
% specified function of time, and the spin rate 1 is held constant by a
% servomotor. Let I1 denote the moment of inertia of the flywheel about
% axis AB, and let I2 be the centroidal moment of inertia perpendicular
% to axis AB. Derive the differential equation of motion for Î².
