%% EXERCISE 3.28
% The entire system rotates about the vertical axis at constant angular speed ω1,
% and the rotation rate ω2 of the rotor relative to bar BC also is constant.
% (a) Describe the angular velocity of the rotor in terms of a superposition of
%     simple rotations.
% (b) Solely from an examination of the description in Part (a), predict the
%     direction(s) in which the angular acceleration of the rotor will be situated
%     relative to the xyz axes defined in the sketch. Briefly explain your answer.
% (c) Describe the angular velocity and angular acceleration of the rotor in terms of
%     compo- nents relative to xyz.
